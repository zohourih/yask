             + If the stencil equations were defined with dependencies on higher-valued steps,

    /**
       "Grid" is a generic term for any n-dimensional array.  A 0-dim grid
       is a scalar, a 1-dim grid is an array, etc.  A run-time grid contains
       data, unlike yc_grid, a compile-time grid variable.  
       
       Typically, access to each grid is obtained via yk_solution::get_grid().
       You may also use yk_solution::new_grid() or yk_solution::new_fixed_size_grid() 
       if you need a grid that is not part of the pre-defined solution.

       Each dimension of a grid is one of the following:
       - The *step* dimension, typically time ("t"), as identified via yk_solution::get_step_dim_name().
       - A *domain* dimension, typically a spatial dimension such as "x" or "y",
       as identified via yk_solution:get_domain_dim_names().
       - A *miscellaneous* dimension, which is any dimension that is not a domain or step dimension,
       as identified via yk_solution:get_misc_dim_names().
       
       In the step dimension, there is no fixed domain size, and no
       specified first or last index.
       However, there is an allocation size, which is the number of values in the step
       dimension that are stored in memory.
       Step-dimension indices "wrap-around" within this allocation to reuse memory.
       For example, if the step dimension is "t", and the t-dimension allocation size is 3,
       then t=-2, t=0, t=3, t=6, ..., t=303, etc. would all alias to the same spatial values in memory.

       In each domain dimension,
       grid sizes include the following components:
       - The *domain* is the elements to which the stencils are applied.
       - The *padding* is the elements outside the domain on either side
       and includes the halo.
       - The *halo* is the elements just outside the domain which must be
       copied between ranks during halo exchanges. The halo is contained within the padding.
       - The *extra padding* is the elements outside the domain and halo on
       either side and thus does not include the halo.
       - The *allocation* includes the domain and the padding.
       
       Domain sizes specified via yk_solution::set_rank_domain_size() apply to each MPI rank.
       Visually, in each of the domain dimensions, these sizes are related as follows
       in each rank:
       <table>
       <tr><td>extra padding <td>halo <td rowspan="2">domain <td>halo <td>extra padding
       <tr><td colspan="2"><center>padding</center> <td colspan="2"><center>padding</center>
       <tr><td colspan="5"><center>allocation</center>
       </table>

       If MPI is not enabled, a rank's domain is equivalent to the entire problem size.
       If MPI is enabled, the domains of the ranks are logically abutted to create the 
       overall problem domain in each dimension:
       <table>
       <tr><td>extra padding of rank A <td>halo of rank A <td>domain of rank A <td>domain of rank B
         <td>... <td>domain of rank Z <td>halo of rank Z <td>extra padding of rank Z
       <tr><td colspan="2"><center>padding of rank A</center>
         <td colspan="4"><center>overall problem domain</center>
         <td colspan="2"><center>padding of rank Z</center>
       </table>
       The intermediate halos and paddings also exist, but are not shown in the above diagram.
       The halos overlap the domains of adjacent ranks.
       For example, the left halo of rank B in the diagram would overlap the domain of rank A.
       Data in these overlapped regions is exchanged as needed during stencil application
       to maintain a consistent values as if there was only one rank.

       In each miscellaneous dimension, there is only an allocation size,
       and there is no wrap-around as in the step dimension.
       Each index must be between its first and last allowed value.

       All sizes are expressed in numbers of elements.
       Each element may be a 4-byte (single precision)
       or 8-byte (double precision) floating-point value as returned by
       yk_solution::get_element_bytes().
       
       Initially, a grid is not assigned any allocated storage.
       This is done to allow modification of domain, padding, and other allocation sizes
       before allocation.
       Once the allocation sizes have been set in all dimensions, the data storage itself may
       be allocated.
       This can be done in any of the following ways:
       - Storage for all grids without data storage will be automatically allocated when
       prepare_solution() is called.
       - Storage for a specific grid may be allocated before calling prepare_solution()
       via yk_grid::alloc_storage().
       - **[Advanced]** Storage for a specific grid may be shared with another grid with
       existing storage via yk_grid::share_storage().
       
       @note The domain index arguments to the \ref yk_grid functions that require indices
       are *always* relative to the overall problem; they are *not* relative to the current rank.
       The first and last overall-problem index that lies within a rank can be
       retrieved via yk_solution::get_first_rank_domain_index() and 
       yk_solution::get_last_rank_domain_index(), respectively.
       The first and last accessible index that lies within a rank for a given grid can be
       retrieved via yk_grid::get_first_rank_alloc_index() and

           - All the FP elements will be located within get_num_storage_bytes()
           bytes from the beginning of the buffer.
           - A call to set_all_elements_same() will initialize all elements
           within get_num_storage_bytes() bytes from the beginning of the buffer.
           - If is_storage_layout_identical() returns `true` between this
           and some other grid, any given element index applied to both grids
           will refer to an element at the same offset into their respective
           data buffers.

           - You can perform element-wise unary mathematical operations on
           all elements of a grid via its raw buffer, e.g., add some constant
           value to all elements.
           - If the layouts of two grids are identical, you can use their
           raw buffers to copy or compare the grid contents for equality or
           perform element-wise binary mathematical operations on them,
           e.g., add all elements from one grid to another.

           The following assumptions are not safe: 
           - Any expectations regarding the relationship between an element
           index and that element's offset from the beginning of the buffer
           such as row-major or column-major layout.
           - All elements in the buffer are part of the rank domain or halo.

           Thus,
           - You should not perform any operations dependent on
           the logical indices of any element via raw buffer, e.g., matrix
           multiply.
